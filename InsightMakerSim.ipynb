    "# InsightMaker Breeding Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight maker is an interactive web page that allows the user to build simulation models and express the process and results through pictures. It is useful to visually illustrate complex simulation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two builds of the simulation. The first is an example simulation, built manually and uses presets as input. The second is a generator that can build a model with a customizable amount of generations and number of unique alleles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Example Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "![examp.png](img/examp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest apprearence of the example simulation. There are 3 spaces representing 3 different locations. Each location will have a population that is given certain characteristics, and as they advance through 5 total generations we can observe the average yield and the proportion of each genotype that survives.\n",
    "\n",
    "![slider.png](img/slider.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Located on the right side of the page is a brief description of what the simulation does. The sliders below the description are used to assign presets to each location's plants. The presets affect each genotypes average yield, the proportion of each allele in the parents, and the cutoff percentage when selecting for the next generation. These numbers are not fully customizable in the example, there are 5 different presets to choose from to observe the differences from preset to preset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Running the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "![simulate.png](img/simulate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph.png](img/graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upper left hand corner of the screen locate the simualte button. After adjusting to the desired presets, click the simulate button. An animated graph will pop up, initially showing the progression of the Y variable (yield) over all 5 generations in all 3 spaces. There are 4 additional tabs (1) to observe the proportion of each genotype over all 5 generations in all 3 spaces. To repeat the animation, the blue play button (2) in the lower left hand corner can be pressed. To remove the results of one space, simply click on the space you would like to remove in the legend of the graph (3) and the line will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Process behind simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "![expand.png](img/expand.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![expanded.png](img/expanded.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking the plus sign in the other left corner of a space's image, we can see the inner workings of the simulation. Note that each Insight variable that uses another Insight variable for input requires a \"link\" (the dotted line), causing the expanded space to have a very messy appearance. This is why we collapse each space into a single image. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![genexample.png](img/genexample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From left to right:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `S3 Preset`: the value of the preset will \"tell\" the variable it is linked to which value to use. \n",
    "   - `P1 A1 Freq`: Value determines what proportion of the specified allele gets passed on to the generation.\n",
    "   - `Parents`: the beginning of the `Flow` (blue lines) where the population will start.\n",
    "   - `G1 Pop`: Total population of the current generation.\n",
    "   - `Flow` (blue lines): These blue lines act as a pipeline from the parents to each genotype. The rate at each plant moves from parent to genotype is based on the linked allele frequencies. ex: `Flow` to `G1 A1A2` is based on `P1 A1 Freq` and `P2 A2 Freq`.\n",
    "   - `G1 A1A1`: The first genotype, it begins at `0` and will get filled up as the generation passes from parents to offspring.\n",
    "   - `A1A1 SD`: The standard deviation of the normal distribution that the designated yield values are pulled from.\n",
    "   - `A1A1 Mean`: The mean of the normal distribution that the designated yield values are pulled from.\n",
    "   - `G1 A1A1 Height`: Samples yield values randomly from a normal distrubtion with the above-defined parameters. The number of sampled values is based on the number of subjects that flow into genotype `G1 A1A1`.\n",
    "   - `G1 Cutoff Perc`: The predetermined cutoff percentage for the yield. ex: if it is `.2` then we are looking at the top 20% of plants.\n",
    "   - `G1 Threshold`: Uses the cutoff percentage and population size to find the number of subjects that represents the desired percentage of the population. ex: with `.2` as the cutoff and `1000` as the population size, we will obtain `200` as the number of plants to keep.\n",
    "   - `G1 Height Cutoff Value`: Sorts all of the yield and finds the threshold subject, and returns the value of the threshold subject. ex: sorts all yield values and finds the `200th` best value.\n",
    "   - `G2 A1A1 Perc`: Drops all values in `G1 A1A1 Height` that are below the `G1 Height Cutoff Value`. The proportion for the next generation is then determined by dividing the numer of kept values by the total threshold. ex: we keep `20` values from `G1 A1A1 Height` out of the `200` total threshold, so the Percentage of `G2 A1A1` in generation 2 will be `.1`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "![mean.png](img/mean.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulls all yield values from a single generation adn takes the average. This value is used for the `Average (Y) by Group`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![prop.png](img/prop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finds the proportion of each genotype from each generation. Creates 3 variables tracked in the other 3 graphs. `A1A2 Prop` and `A2A1 prop` values are added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "![button.png](img/button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator is simply a button. With Insightmaker, JavaScript code can be put inside of the button and will run by simply clicking on the button.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Running the generator\n",
    "\n",
    "![gennumber.png](img/gennumber.png)\n",
    "![allelenumber.png](img/allelenumber.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After clicking the button, the user will be prompted through the browser to input the desired number of generations and alleles being tracked per parent. For this tutorial 4 generations and 4 alleles were chosen. After answering the two prompts the model will automatically be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "![genmodel.png](img/genmodel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This generated model is structured the same way as the example model, albeit there is not multiple spaces. With this version we can adjust virtually every variable from each genotypes average yield to the cutoff percentage for each generation. To bring up the sliders, click on any piece of the model, then click the white space outside the models and the sliders will appear on the right side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "![sliders.png](img/sliders.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These sliders have a few conditions that must be met for the simulation to properly run.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each parent's allele frequencies must add up to 1. For example: P1 A1 + P1 A2 + P1 A3 + P1 A4 = 1.\n",
    "   - Genotype names are interchangeable, that is, A1A3 is the same as A3A1. The variables associated with these genotypes must be equal. If the average yield of A1A3 is 7, then the yield of A3A1 must also be 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these conditions satisfied the simulation will be able to pass through generations appropriately, however there is one unresolved issue preventing the generator for working.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Unresolved issues\n",
    "\n",
    "InsightMaker automatically adds newly created variables to the graph that appears when `simulate` is pressed. When the generator creates the model, every box and item put into the space is considered a variable and is added to a single graph. The issue is the graph cannot be specified to track certain variables until the variables are actually created. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution likely lies somewhere in the InsightMaker API which allows interaction with javascript and custom functions that affect the Insight. The working idea is to creat another button with the appropriate javascript code that will return the correct graphs."
