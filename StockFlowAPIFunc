Dialogues/User Input

showPrompt - prompts user for input of value. Could be desired number of generations/genotypes and this could then generate the model.
showChoice - prompts the user with text and choice of "ok" or "cancel." Could be used to initiate a tutorial or cancel it if it is a repeat user
showData - creates display data
openFile - prompts user to input file. Possible an input of all the phenotype distribution data?

General Model Functions

layoutModel - Organizes primitives according to algorithm

Simulation Settings

setTimeLength - set length of sim. Maybe set it equal to desired amount of generations
getAlgorithm -gets algorithm
setAlgorithm - can set an algorithm (could be diff by choice)
set/getMacros - set or get macros

Accessing Primitives

findName - access by name
findAll - access all
findType - access by type
findValue - access by matching value (match a regular expression? Not sure)
findNote - access by matching notes (match a regular express too)

Create/Delete Primitives
